#take a text block and turn into sentences 
#break each setences into DICT with POS and make a dictionary like nouns -> [], verbs -> [], etc
#classifit each sentence with complexity score and then get overall normalized complexity score 
#that overall complexity score will determine that texts score and influence overall total complexity that the user tends to use
#that complexity along with quality of words, varietty and diversity, text length, etc imform the level of the user
#which in turn affect which prompts they get and how they get scored
